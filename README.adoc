= Tebako a image packager

== Purpose

This software packages a set of files into a dwarFS file system for
read-only purposes.

After packaging the file system, Tebako produces a single executable
binary that allows the user to execute a selected file from the packaged
software from a point in the file system.

== Goals

The packaged binary should support:

* Packaging a default dwarFS image inside the binary
* Support signing of the binary on macOS (via notarization)

In the future:

* Downloading new dwarFS images to be stored in the local home directory
* Allowing loading multiple dwarFS images in a stacked way
* Supporting a COW mechanism that the newly written files are stored
  in a separate image that can be loaded on top of the read-only file systems.
